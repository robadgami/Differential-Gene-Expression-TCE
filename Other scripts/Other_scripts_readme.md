### OTHER SCRIPTS

1. **Venn diagrams **

   1. Grep the differentially expressed genes for each segment of the Venn diagram.
   2. Make Euler venn diagrams via [venndiagram.R](/Users/rbadgami/Desktop/untitled folder/1_Data_Preparation/Other_scripts/venndiagram.R)

2. **Ternary plots for comparing gene expression**

   1. Make ternary plots to visualise which cultivar genes are more expressed in via [ternaryplot_F22.R](/Users/rbadgami/Desktop/untitled folder/1_Data_Preparation/Other_scripts/ternary_F22.R).

   ##### Comparing cluster patterns between hosts

   Once cluster patterns over time for each host has been obtained, interesting molecular process differences can be investigated by comparing DGE pattern clusters between hosts. The method used to do this is explained in [Comparing_Clusters](https://github.com/robadgami/Differential-Gene-Expression-TCE/blob/master/Comparing_Clusters/Explanation%20on%20Comparing%20Cluster%20graphs.md "Explanation on Comparing Cluster graphs.md"), along with the accompanying bash script [Clust_comparison.sh](https://github.com/robadgami/Differential-Gene-Expression-TCE/blob/master/Comparing_Clusters/Clust_comparison.sh "Clust_comparison.sh") and R.script [Clustergraphs.R](https://github.com/robadgami/Differential-Gene-Expression-TCE/blob/master/Comparing_Clusters/Clustgraphs.R "Clustergraphs.R").
